# 🏦 Customer Segmentation for a Bank  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Customer segmentation is a crucial task for banks to tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer service. This project employs **K-Means Clustering** and **DBSCAN Clustering** to analyze bank customers based on their demographics and financial behavior. By identifying distinct customer groups, banks can personalize their offerings and optimize engagement.  

We explore different clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction methods to extract meaningful patterns from the data. The project also includes insightful visualizations to interpret the results effectively.
