# 🏦 Customer Segmentation for a Bank  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Customer segmentation is a crucial task for banks to tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer service. This project employs **K-Means Clustering** and **DBSCAN Clustering** to analyze bank customers based on their demographics and financial behavior. By identifying distinct customer groups, banks can personalize their offerings and optimize engagement.  

We explore different clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction methods to extract meaningful patterns from the data. The project also includes insightful visualizations to interpret the results effectively.

## 🚀 Key Features  
✔ **Customer Clustering** – Using unsupervised learning to segment customers based on their financial attributes  
✔ **K-Means Clustering** – Implemented and visualized for pattern recognition  
✔ **DBSCAN Clustering** – Planned for exploring density-based clustering  
✔ **Dimensionality Reduction** – **PCA** to reduce feature complexity  
✔ **Interactive Dashboards** – Planned **Tableau** for deep insights  
✔ **Data Visualization** – Using **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for exploratory analysis
